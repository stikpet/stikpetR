\title{Pearson Q1}
\usage{
es_pearson_q1(var1, var2)
}
\arguments{
\item{var1}{A vector with the binary data from the first variable}

\item{var2}{A vector with the binary data from the second variable}
}
\value{
Pearson Q1
}
\description{
Pearson Q1
}
\details{
The formula used (Pearson, 1900, p. 15):
\deqn{Q_1 = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \times \frac{a\times d - b\times c}{\left(a+b\right)\times\left(b+d\right)}\right)}

With:
The cross table arranged such that \eqn{a\times d > b\times c}, \eqn{a>d}, and \eqn{c>b}.

\emph{Symbols used:}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{a} the count in the top-left cell of the cross table
\item \eqn{b} the count in the top-right cell of the cross table
\item \eqn{c} the count in the bottom-left cell of the cross table
\item \eqn{d} the count in the bottom-right cell of the cross table
}

Note that Pearson (1900) stated: "Q1 was found of little service" (p. 16).

Note that Pearson Q2 is the same as Yule Q and Pearson Q3 is the same as Yule r.
