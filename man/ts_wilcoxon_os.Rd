\description{
The one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test is often considered the non-parametric version of a one-sample t-test.
It can be used to determine if the median is significantly different from an hypothesized value. It actually
doesn't always tests this specifically, but more if the mean rank is significantly different.

If the p-value is the probability of a result as in the sample, or more extreme, if the assumption about the
population would be true. If this is below a certain threshold (usually 0.05) the assumption about the
population is rejected. For this test the assumed median for the population is then incorrect.

Results in software packages for this test can vary, since there are a few different approaches. Especially if
there are so-called ties. See the details for more information.
}
\details{
The unadjusted test statistic is given by:
\deqn{W=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}^{+}}r_{i}^{+}}
With:
\deqn{r=\textup{rank}(|d|)}
\deqn{d_{i}=y_{i}-\theta}

\emph{Symbols used:}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{n_{r}^{+}} is the number of ranks with a positive deviation from the hypothesized median
\item \eqn{r_{i}^{+}} the i-th rank of the ranks with a positive deviation from the hypothesized median
\item \eqn{\theta} is the median tested (the hypothesized median).
\item \eqn{y_i} is the i-th score of the variable after removing scores that were equal to \eqn{\theta}
}

If there are no ties, an exact method can be used, using the Sign Rank Distribution.
R has this available with \emph{psignrank()}.
The exact test can be found in Zaiontz (n.d.)

\strong{Approximations}

If the sample size is large enough, we can use a normal approximation.
What is large enough varies quite per author. A few examples: n > 8 (slideplayer, 2015),
n > 15 (SigMaxl, n.d.), n > 20 (Wikipedia, n.d.), n > 25 (Harris & Hardin, 2013),
n > 30 (Winthrop, n.d.) .

The z-statistic is given by (appr="wilcoxon", ties=FALSE, cc=FALSE):
\deqn{Z = \frac{W - \mu_w}{\sigma_w}}
or with a ties correction (appr="wilcoxon", ties=TRUE, cc=FALSE):
\deqn{Z_{adj} = \frac{W - \mu_w}{\sigma_w^*}}
With:
\deqn{\mu_w = \frac{n_r\times\left(n_r + 1\right)}{4}}
\deqn{\sigma_w^2 = \frac{n_r\times\left(n_r + 1\right)\times\left(2\times n_r + 1\right)}{24}}
\deqn{\sigma_w^{*2} = \sigma_w^2 - A}
\deqn{A = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \left(t_i^3 - t_i\right)}{48}}

\emph{Additional symbols used}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{n_{r}} is the number of ranks used
\item \eqn{k} the number of unique ranks
\item \eqn{t_i} the frequency of the i-th unique rank
}

A Yates continuity correction can simply be applied:
In case of no ties (appr="wilcoxon", ties=FALSE, cc=TRUE):
\deqn{Z = \frac{\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5}{\sigma_w}}
In case of ties (appr="wilcoxon", ties=TRUE, cc=TRUE):
\deqn{Z_{adj} = \frac{\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5}{\sigma_w^*}}

An alternative approximation using the Student t distribution is given by Iman (1974, p. 799).
The formula is (appr="imant", ties=FALSE, cc=FALSE):
\deqn{t = \frac{W - \mu_w}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_w^2\times n_r - \left(W - \mu_w\right)^2}{n_r - 1}}}}
or with the ties correction (appr="imant", ties=TRUE, cc=FALSE):
\deqn{t = \frac{W - \mu_w}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_w^{*2}\times n_r - \left(W - \mu_w\right)^2}{n_r - 1}}}}

The two versions for with a continuity correction are:
No ties correction, but continuity (appr="imant", ties=FALSE, cc=TRUE):
\deqn{t = \frac{\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_w^2\times n_r - \left(\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5\right)^2}{n_r - 1}}}}
Both corrections (appr="imant", ties=TRUE, cc=TRUE):
\deqn{t = \frac{\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_w^{*2}\times n_r - \left(\left|W - \mu_w\right| - 0.5\right)^2}{n_r - 1}}}}

Iman (1974, p. 803) also provides a combination of the t-approximation and the regular z-approximation
The equation is given by (appr="imanz"):
\deqn{Z_{I} = \frac{Z}{2}\times\left(1 + \sqrt{\frac{n_r - 1}{n_r - Z^2}}\right)}
The \eqn{Z} is any of the previous methods.

\strong{Ties with mu}

The default (eqMed="wilcoxon") removes first any scores that are equal to the hypothesized median.
There are two alternative methods for this.Both re-define \eqn{d_i} to:
\deqn{d_i = x_i - \theta}
Where \eqn{x_i} is simply the i-th score.

For the z-split method we only need to re-define:
\deqn{W = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{d_0}}r_{i,0}}{2} + \sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}^{+}}r_{i}^{+}}
Where \eqn{n_{d_0}} is the number of scores that equal the hypothesized median, and
\eqn{r_{i,0}} is the rank of the i-th score that equals the hypothesized median.

In essence we added half the sum of the ranks that were equal to the hypothesized median.

For the z-split method all other calculations than go the same.

For the Pratt (1959) method we also re-define:
\deqn{\mu_w = \frac{n_r\times\left(n_r + 1\right) - n_{d_0}\times\left(n_{d_0} + 1\right)}{4}}
\deqn{\sigma_w^2 = \frac{n_r\times\left(n_r + 1\right)\times\left(2\times n_r + 1\right) - n_{d_0}\times\left(n_{d_0} + 1\right)\times\left(2\times n_{d_0} + 1\right)}{24}}

For the Pratt method, the ties correction still excludes the ties
for the scores that equal the hypothesized median,
but for the z-split method it will include them.

For both methods now \eqn{n_r=n}, where n is the number of scores.

The Pratt (1959) method and z-split method were found in Python’s documentation
for scipy’s Wilcoxon function (scipy, n.d.). They also refer to Cureton (1967) for the Pratt method.
