\description{
The Hodges-Lehmann estimate, is the median of all the possible differences between two sets of data. The authors (Hodges & Lehmann, 1984) describe it as the location shift that is needed to align two distributions (with similar distributions) as much as possible (p. 599).

It is sometimes incorrectly described as the difference between the two medians, but that is incorrect. It is not uncommon to have a different Hodges-Lehmann estimate than simply taking the difference between the two medians.

This measure is sometimes mentioned as an effect size measure for a Mann-Whitney U / Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (van Geloven, 2018), however since it is a median of the possible differences, it is not standardized (i.e. it doesn't range between two fixed values, and depends therefor on the data).
}
\details{
The formula for the Hodges-Lehmann estimator with two samples is (Hodges & Lehmann, 1963, p. 602):

\deqn{HL = \text{median}\left(x_i - y_j | 1 \leq i \leq n_x, 1 \leq j \leq n_y\right)}

\emph{Symbols used:}
\itemize{
\item  \eqn{x_i} the i-th score in category x
\item \eqn{x_j} the j-th score in category y
\item  \eqn{n_i} the number of scores in category i
}

There might be a faster method to actually determine this. Algorithm 616 (Monahan, 1984), but couldn't translate the Fortran to R
