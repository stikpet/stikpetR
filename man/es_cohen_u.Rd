\title{Cohen U}
\usage{
es_cohen_u(d, version = "u3")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{the Cohen d value}

\item{version}{{"u3", "u2", "u1"}, Optional, the version of Cohen U to determine}
}
\value{
The Cohen U value
}
\description{
Cohen (1988, p. 23) provided three measures that relate to Cohen's d.
\itemize{
\item  \eqn{U_1}, is (supposedly) the proportion of non-overlap between distributions
\item  \eqn{U_2}, is (supposedly) the proportion of overlap between distributions
\item  \eqn{U_3}, is the proportion of one group's scores below the mean of another group
}

\eqn{U_1} and \eqn{U_2} are probably the least used of these three, since most likeley Cohen was wrong in his calculation (Grice & Barrett, 2014). A nice interactive visualisation of the relation between Cohen and the Common Language Effect size, can be found at https://rpsychologist.com/therapist-effects. It actually correct's Cohen U.

By converting each back to Cohen's d, the rule-of-thumb from Cohen d could be used as classification.
}
\details{
The following formulas are used (Cohen, 1988, p. 23):
\deqn{U_3 = \Phi\left(d\right)}
\deqn{U_2 = \Phi\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)}
\deqn{U_1 = \Phi\left(\frac{2\times U_2 - 1}{U_2}\right)}

\emph{Symbols used:}
\itemize{
\item  \eqn{d}, Cohen's d value
\item \eqn{n_i} the number of scores in category i
\item  \eqn{\Phi\left(\dots\right)} the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution
}
