\usage{
es_scott_pi(field1, field2, categories = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{field1}{vector, the first categorical field}

\item{field2}{vector, the first categorical field}

\item{categories}{vector, optional, order and/or selection for categories of field1 and field2}
}
\value{
Dataframe with:
\item{Scott pi}{the Scott pi value}
\item{n}{the sample size}
\item{statistic}{the test statistic (z-value)}
\item{p-value}{the significance (p-value)}
}
\description{
An effect size meaure, that measures the how strongly two raters or variables, agree with each other. Full agreement would result in a pi of 1.

The measure is very similar to Cohen's kappa. The difference is with the calculation of the expected marginal proportions. Cohen's kappa uses a squared geometric mean, while Scott's pi uses squared arithmetic means.

Scott developed this in criticism on Bennett-Alpert-Goldstein's S (see es_bag_s()).

\details{
The formula used (Scott, 1955, p. 323):
\deqn{\pi = \frac{p_0 - p_e}{1 - p_e}}

With:
\deqn{P = \sum_{i=1}^r F_{i,i}}
\deqn{p_0 = \frac{P}{n}}
\deqn{p_e = \sum_{i=1}^r\left(\frac{R_i + C_i}{2\times n}\right)^2}

The asymptotic standard errors is calculated using (Scott, 1955, p. 325):
\deqn{ASE = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{1 - p_e}\right)^2\times\frac{p_0\times\left(1 - p_0\right)}{n - 1}}}

The p-value (significance) is then calculated using:
\deqn{z_{\pi} = \frac{\pi}{ASE}}
\deqn{sig. = 2\times\left(1 - \Phi\left(z_{\kappa}\right)\right)}

\emph{Symbols used}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{F_{i,j}}, the observed count in row i and column j.
\item \eqn{r}, is the number of rows (categories in the first variable)
\item \eqn{c}, is the number of columns (categories in the second variable)
\item \eqn{n}, is the total number of scores
\item \eqn{R_i}, the row total of row i.\eqn{R_i = \sum_{j=1}^c F_{i,j}}
\item \eqn{C_j}, the column total of column j.\eqn{C_j = \sum_{i=1}^r F_{i,j}}
}
