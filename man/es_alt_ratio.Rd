\usage{
es_alt_ratio(data, p0 = 0.5, p0Cat = NULL, codes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{vector with the data}

\item{p0}{Optional hypothesized proportion for the first category (default is 0.5)}

\item{p0Cat}{Optional the category for which p0 was used}

\item{codes}{Optional vector with the two codes to use}
}
\value{
Dataframe with:
\item{AR1}{the alternative category for one category}
\item{AR2}{the alternative category for the other category}
\item{comment}{the category for which p0 was}
}
\description{
The Alternative Ratio is an effect size measure that could be accompanying a one-sample binomial, score or Wald test.It is simply the sample proportion (percentage), divided by the expected population proportion (often set at 0.5)

The Alternative Ratio is only mentioned in the documentation of a program called PASS from NCSS (n.d.), and referred to as Relative Risk by JonB (2015).

This function is shown in this \href{https://youtu.be/IwZph3C9xFc}{YouTube video} and the effect size is also described at \href{https://peterstatistics.com/Terms/EffectSizes/AlternativeRatio.html}{PeterStatistics.com}
}
\details{
To decide on which category is associated with p0 the following is used:
\itemize{
\item If codes are provided, the first code is assumed to be the category for the p0.
\item If p0Cat is specified that will be used for p0 and all other categories will be considered as category 2, this means if there are more than two categories the remaining two or more (besides p0Cat) will be merged as one large category.
\item If neither codes or p0Cat is specified and more than two categories are in the data a warning is printed and no results.
\item If neither codes or p0Cat is specified and there are two categories, p0 is assumed to be for the category closest matching the p0 value (i.e. if p0 is above 0.5 the category with the highest count is assumed to be used for p0)
}

The formula used is:
\deqn{AR=\frac{p}{\pi}}

\emph{Symbols used}:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{p} is the sample proportion of one of the categories
\item \eqn{\pi} the expected proportion
}
}
\section{Before, After and Alternatives}{

Before this effect size you might first want to perform a test:
\code{\link{ts_binomial_os}}, for One-Sample Binomial Test
\code{\link{ts_score_os}}, for One-Sample Score Test
\code{\link{ts_wald_os}}, for One-Sample Wald Test

Unfortunately I'm not aware of any rule-of-thumb for this measure.

Alternatives for this effect size could be:
\code{\link{es_cohen_g}}, for Cohen g
\code{\link{es_cohen_h_os}}, for Cohen h'
\code{\link{r_rosenthal}}, for Rosenthal Correlation if a z-value is available
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Numeric list
ex1 = c(1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
es_alt_ratio(ex1)
es_alt_ratio(ex1, p0=0.3)

# Example 2: Text list
ex2 = c("Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male")
es_alt_ratio(ex2)
es_alt_ratio(ex2, category='Female')
es_alt_ratio(ex2, codes=c('Male', 'Female'))

# Example 3: dataframe
file1 <- "https://peterstatistics.com/Packages/ExampleData/GSS2012a.csv"
df1 <- read.csv(file1, sep=",", na.strings=c("", "NA"))
es_alt_ratio(df1['sex'])
es_alt_ratio(df1['mar1'], codes=c("DIVORCED", "NEVER MARRIED"))
