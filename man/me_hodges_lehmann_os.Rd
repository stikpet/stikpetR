\description{
The Hodges-Lehmann Estimate (Hodges & Lehmann, 1963) for a one-sample scenario, is the median of the Walsh averages. The Walsh averages (Walsh, 1949a, 1949b) are the average of each possible pair by taking one score and combining it with each of the other scores. Note that each is only counted once, so taking the second and fifth score is the same as taking the fifth and the second, so only one of these is used. It does also include self-pairs, e.g. the third score and third score.

It is in the one-sample case therefor a measure of central tendancy and sometimes referred to as the pseudo median.

The formula used (Hodges & Lehmann, 1963, p. 599):
\deqn{HL = \text{median}\left(\frac{x_i + x_j}{2} | i \leq i \leq j \leq n\right)}
